current state
-------------

spicy app starts becoming usable.

Library API is far from being stable.  Likewise the ABI of course.
If you play with the libs make sure you rebuild everything after
updating the library for the time being.

Some features are missing:
  - No sound recording support.
  - No client migration support.
  - No mm time handling.
  - Most channel implementations are incomplete.
  - Almost no documentation.
  - Probably more ...
